#Crop production is the process of growing crops for domestic and commercial purposes. The entire world depends on agriculture for food. Agriculture and its industries are major contributors to the US economy. This project will aim at predicting crop yield based on location and weather data which would eventually help farmers to know about the crop yield for several counties in the United States. We will take into account different geographical aspects like latitude and longitude, State, County, and temperature data. Data is collected from the aerial intel dataset. These data are geolocated to specific lat-longs and counties.
